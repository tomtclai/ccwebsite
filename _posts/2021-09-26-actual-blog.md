It’s been a lonnng time since I made any updates to the blog or personal site or whatever, some updates

I’m now: 
- 27
- Single (again) 
- Sipping free coffee at Starbucks 
- Listening to Selena Gomez’s Who Says



“Who says you’re not beautiful, who says?”

“Who says you don’t pass the test?”

“Who says you’re not perfect?”

I listen to these lyrics and I’m like I can easily name like 10.. 

As Joan River says, “I wish I could tell you it gets better. It doesn’t get better. You get better.”

I reminisce on the past relationships that I’ve failed…. (And notice i say “I failed” because its so hard to not think it is your fault… when in reality, it is no ones fault, but anyway). It is sad, but I don’t regret because with every failure we learn something. Whether the lesson is expensive or not. 

I’m starting my 27th with a new perspective of what i want out of life. What i want in a relationship. What i want to be at 30… And who cares if it all changes in a year. I'll learn and adapt.

Onwards and upwards. 🛫
