title: a new domain
---

in case anyone have been reading this and they notice the new url, I just want to say that, yes, I got a new domain `toml.ai`... 
It is much shorter than the old one `tomtclai.com` because I'm lazy and/or vain.  

I thought about it after the fact, it's almost like a vanity plate. Its like having a plate that says tom.

I don't know how I feel about it, but I still have all the domains and I can always change it back

### Setting it up was kind of fun & easy (maybe?)

my page was already hosted by github pages; and i have a new domain `toml.ai` so I just point it to the same github page in the DNS settings. [(cloudflare tutorial)](https://blog.cloudflare.com/secure-and-fast-github-pages-with-cloudflare/)

I did run into some issues because github pages doesnt support multiple domains. No worries! I cloned the repo so both the new and old domain would have contentðŸ˜›

> When i say clone, i mean i went to github, marked the old repo as a template, and then clicked a button... not git operation required (again im lazy)

At the end, i did decide to just route all traffic from the old url `tomtclai.com` to the new one `toml.ai` (cloudflare page rules).. so now the old repo is no longer in use ðŸ˜…

The last thing I learned is that if i use `.ai` top level domain, i can't really transfer registration from namecheap (where i bought the domain) to cloudflare, since cloudflare dont support the tld. Oh well... thats okay. I can still use cloudflare for DNS.

> Did you know that all the novel top level domains like `.ai` and `.io` are originally allocated to different regions of the world? (e.g. `.io` was meant [for indian ocean](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/.io), `.ai` [for anguilla (sorry)](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/.ai))

### Now time for more blogging

How am I? I've been doing pretty well... 

As you may know, I meditate sometimes, and I have gotten into some pretty *wild* guided meditations (thanks Sam Harris). That like, your thoughts are not technically you... etc

You may ask, if I'm just a conciousness and all the thoughts and desires (that I'm hearing) are not coming from me, then what is the point of doing anything? 

Welcome to the club!

I don't believe there is a point. 

There will always be new wants and needs. You can chase one thing, then get it, and then pretty soon you will want someting new...

As in, you will never be satisfied. 
 
Isn't it weird? As smart as we are, we forget that we are human. hardwired to never be satisfied. nothing is ever enough for us. but then i guess, thats why we are the top of the food chain..

It's like what i say about the imposter syndrome. While it can be too much sometimes... I think the fact that you keep trying to improve your skills, is what makes you so good at it. ðŸ›«
