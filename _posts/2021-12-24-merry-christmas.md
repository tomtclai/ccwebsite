Merry Christmas (eve) y'all.

I'm at a starbucks again. It seems like I only ever blog at starbucks.

The omicron be coming. in BC, Canada, gyms are closed for a month. 

I'll remind myself here everything is temporary and I should cherish what I have right now. For it all might be gone tomorrow.

We are so crazily privileged compared to other countries. 

I was watching the first episode of "And just like that..." last night with most of the *Sex and the City* Cast except Samantha. 

and spolier alert.... ~~Big passed away~~. 

If there is anything I learned so far it is that life is short, ephemeral, and fragile. 

It might snow tonight or tomorrow. I'll look forward to that.

I don't know who's reading this (probably just me), but if I don't write again before new years eve... Happy New Year! 

I wish you a good 2022. I wish you get everything that you hoped for. I hope you'll be happy.
