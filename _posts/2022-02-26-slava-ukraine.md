I cannot believe in 2022 we still have war. It made me very sad when I first heard the news. It reminded me of when [the chinese troops raided hong kong](https://www.news.com.au/world/shocking-footage-of-hong-kong-police-attacking-locals-inside-subway-station/video/00b07d7abe389ee631c5abf5fd377b4d). 

Two days later [the video of russian tank runing a car over](https://twitter.com/Balshone/status/1497178406617759745) surfaced the internet.  I have no words. 

Some of my coworkers (new and old) are from Ukraine. They are safe in Canada, but their friends are not. That worries me. 

I've been consuming news non-stop. Every hour there is something new, it is one atrocity after another. And i just have no idea at this point how much worse it could get.

I will share [this tweet](https://twitter.com/Ukraine/status/1497594592438497282)
